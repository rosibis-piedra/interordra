## What It Does

InterOrdra analyzes any pair of texts and shows you exactly where and why they don't understand each other - revealing gaps in vocabulary, orphaned concepts, and topological misalignment in meaning-space.

## Use Cases

- Technical documentation vs user questions
- Expert explanations vs public understanding  
- AI prompts vs expected responses
- Scientific papers vs popular articles
